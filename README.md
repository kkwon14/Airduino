The Airduino
========

Modern day air conditioners are typically manufactured with built-in temperature and humidity sensors, but what if you own an older model? If you don’t have an automatic on/off, display with time, temperature, and humidity level, the Airduino may be the perfect upgrade. The Airduino uses a servo motor, display, temperature/humidity sensor, atomic clock, and an Arduino. It features auto on/off at a specific time so you can save electricity costs and stay cool before you get home. The temperature and humidity sensor may be more accurate and realistic than a smart air conditioner because it could be placed further away from the cooling source (i.e. the center of the room). It also considers both temperature and humidity to derive an “apparent temperature” which can be used as an on/off trigger. With these upgrades, you can make your air conditioner even smarter.

A robotics/Arduino project to add additional features to an old window air conditioner unit.
